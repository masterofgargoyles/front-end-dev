start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

The <body> element defines the document's body.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

<img src="img_girl.jpg">

The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
